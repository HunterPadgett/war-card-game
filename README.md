## Usage

To start a new game, click the "play game" button. The deck will be shuffled and each player will be dealt 26 cards. The game consists of a series of rounds, in which each player draws a card from their deck. The player with the higher card wins the round and earns a point. If the cards are of the same value, a "war" is declared, in which each player draws three additional cards and the player with the higher fourth card wins the round.

The game continues until one player has won all of the cards. The winner is then declared.
